# Super Pang

Simple clone of Super Pang as a college assignment.

Works purely in client side, no server needed. Also, the code has been untouched from what was originally delivered, so it would benefit from a refactoring, not necessarily to use a framework, but at least to clean up the functions and fix some CSS, which is applied badly from JS most of the times.
